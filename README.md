# VSCode C/C++ Config

Creates config files for simple C/C++ projects.  

If the standard (non-minimal) command is used, the following files will be created in the local .vscode folder:

- settings.json: Best default settings for C/C++, CMake etc. extensions
- c_cpp_properties.json: Best default settings for the compiler
- tasks.json: Tasks to compile single C/C++ files or all C/C++ files in a folder
- launch.json: Debug configs to debug C/C++ programs that were compiled by the tasks
- Makefile: Makefile targets that are used in launch.json and tasks.json

if the minimal command is used, the following files will be created in the local .vscode folder:

- settings.json: Best default settings for C/C++, CMake etc. extensions
- c_cpp_properties.json: Best default settings for the compiler

Following files will be created in the root directory for all commands:

- .clang-format: Configuration for the formatting tool
- .clang-tidy: Configuration for the static linting tool
- .editorconfig: Standard editor settings (line-feed, insert new-line, etc.)
- .gitattributes: Gives attributes to pathnames
- .gitingore: Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore

**Note**: If one of these files already exists, they won't be overridden.
