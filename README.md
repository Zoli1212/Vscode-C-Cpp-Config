# VSCode C/C++ Config

Creates all needed config files for simple C/C++ projects.  

Following files will be created in the local .vscode folder:

- settings.json: Best default settings for C/C++, CMake etc. extensions

- tasks.json: Tasks to compile single C/C++ files or all C/C++ files in a folder
- launch.json: Debug configs to debug C/C++ programs that were compiled by the tasks
- Makefile: Makefile targets that are used in launch.json and tasks.json

Following files will be created in the root directory:

- .clang-format: Formatting style if the user wants to use clang-format
- .editorconfig: Standard file settings (line-feed, insert new-line, etc.)

**Note**: If one of these files already exists, they won't be overridden.
